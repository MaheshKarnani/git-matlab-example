The aim of this exercise is to collaboratively develop an analysis script for behavioural data generated in AutonoMouse. 
Use the 'Master' script as a guide for the initial analysis steps needed.

The Data folder contains data from a group of 14 animals performing various odour and auditory discrimination tasks (Go/No-Go). Animals perform these tasks before
and after lesion induction in the olfactory bulb via excitotoxic NMDA lesions.

The data set is a structure organised by individual animal. Within each animal are the tasks performed and the amount of NMDA injected for lesion induction (0 = sham).
Tasks performed after lesion induction are marked with 'PL'. Within each task are the results of each trial within the task (e.g. time of trial, whether trial was rewarded,
whether animal was correct etc.)

Initial task (see Master):
Compare average animal performance before and after lesion induction in the memory task. Also compare between lesion groups (sham vs. lesion).

Throughout this task, update the README file to describe each of the functions generated and the purpose of the Master script.
